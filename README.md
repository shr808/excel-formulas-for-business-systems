# Excel Formulas for Business and Administrative Systems

This repository documents commonly used Excel formulas for
data lookup, analysis, cleaning, reporting, and decision-making.

The examples are based on real-world use cases such as:
- Academic and administrative reporting
- Internal dashboards
- Data cleanup after system exports
- Operational and workflow tracking

The focus is on clarity, maintainability, and practical usage
rather than complex macros or VBA.
